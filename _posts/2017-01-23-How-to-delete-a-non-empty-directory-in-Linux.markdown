title: How to delete a non-empty directory in Linux
---
Here, the running environment is Ubuntu 16.04

For instance you have a directory folder named 'myDir', and it contains some stuff

Use
'rm -rf myDir'

It will delete all files and folders and stuffs and cats inside 'myDir'

Note: if you are not at the same level of the folder, you will want to use the folder's absolute path.

Note2: If you do not have the permission, use 'sudo'.
